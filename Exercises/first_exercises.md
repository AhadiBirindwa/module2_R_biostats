It is important that you practice your data manipulation skills with R. Please solve the exercises below without skipping any. You can use "standard R" as well as all the packages from the *tidyverse* galaxy.

1. Using the "FEV dataset" freshly imported from the file `Datasets/fev_dataset.txt`, calculate the statistical summary of all the heigths. What is the 10% quantile of that distribution? How would you explain what that value is, using your own words? What is the value of the 90% quantile of all heigths? 

2. Using the same dataset, draw boxplots representing the distribution of heights for all the ages between 6 and 10 inclusive (one boxplot per age, all on the same plot).

3. On the same dataset, **add a column**  called `Gender2` being the translation the column `Gender` into character values "Boy" (when `Gender` contains 1) and "Girl" (when `Gender` contains 0).
