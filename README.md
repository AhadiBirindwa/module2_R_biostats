# module2_R_biostats
Training module of the Bioinformatics Community of Practice on R and biostatistics

Please read carefully the R history files, you will learn a lot from reviewing them at home, and whenever you have a question like "And in this command, what if I would change this option or this syntactic element?", then please proceed and try by yourself! **Best way to learn! :)**
